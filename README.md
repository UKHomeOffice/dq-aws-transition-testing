# DQ AWS Transition Testing

Exploring testing for Terraform. Using the [dq-terraform-demo](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/dq-terraform-demo) code as a starting point to test. Focusing on the acceptance criteria of the [mock application](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/dq-aws-transition/issues/38) and the AWS status check criteria.
